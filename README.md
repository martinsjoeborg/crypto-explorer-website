<h1>Crypto Explorer</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
The site aims to simulate some of the most popular use cases in crypto at a very elementary level.
The target group is mainly users with little to no experience with web3 websites.

<h3>What you need</h3>
To use this website you need a metamask wallet, be connected to the sepolia testnet, have sepoliaETH in your wallet and import the native token XPLRCOIN at address: 0xF0e01BAbCd26Be4A6eaC43d823E26396ee34A118

<h2>OBS!</h2>
<h5>Please open the deployed page with the Chrome or Brave browser, it works best.</h5>
 
<h4>What I have learned:</h4>
From working on this project, I have learned how to create tokens on the sepolia network, construct smart contracts with solidity that lets a user swap, stake, borrow and lend tokens. 
I have also learned a lot about deploying React Vite projects to Github Pages. 

<h4>The project is a work in progress and I aim to expand the current content and add functionality to the "DAO" and "NFT" pages.</h4>
