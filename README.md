This is my degree project for the course "Blockchain Development" at Medieinstitutet in Sweden.

The site aims to simulate some of the most popular use cases in crypto at a very elementary level.

The target group is mainly users with little to no experience with web3 websites.

To use this website you need a metamask wallet, be connected to the sepolia testnet, have sepoliaETH in your wallet and import the native token XPLRCOIN at address: 0xF0e01BAbCd26Be4A6eaC43d823E26396ee34A118
